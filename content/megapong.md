Mega Pong is a variant of Beer Pong where you instead play with tennis balls and 10 L buckets.

### Equipment and setup
- Three players per team.
- 6 buckets per team.
- 3 tennis balls.
- Set the buckets to a triangle shape, with the backlines of the formations being 5 m apart.

### Rules
- Start the game by playing rock-paper-scissors. The winning team gets to decide which team throws first.
- The object of the game is to throw the tennis balls into the opposing teams buckets.
- Each member of a team throws one tennis ball and then the throwing turn switches.
- If you get a ball into a bucket, the bucket stays on the field until the end of the turn.
- If you get two balls into the same bucket, you get to choose an additional bucket to remove from the field (total of 2 buckets).
- If you get three balls into the same bucket, you get to choose an additional two buckets to remove from the field (total of 3 buckets).
- Once a team has removed at least three buckets from the field, they can ask for a reracking of the buckets still on the field. The new shape must touch the backline, and each bucket must touch at least one other bucket.
- Bounces are counted as one hit.
- Throws are not to be blocked.

### End of game
- The game goes to an end state when one team removes all the buckets of the opposing team.
- The last bucket removed must be properly hit, it cannot be removed from the field by proxy.
- Once the last bucket is removed, the losing team gets a chance at redemption.
- The team throws continues throwing as long as they hit a bucket or miss.
- If they also remove all the buckets from the field, the game restarts with three buckets on each team in a triangle shape.
- The game is then continued normally, the team that first removed all the buckets from the field gets to start.
- The winner of the game is the team that removes all the buckets of the opposing team without the opposing team getting a redemption.
- The judges have a right to end any game that has continued over 20 minutes. The winner is then decided by the amount of buckets hit or by coinflip if the points are even.

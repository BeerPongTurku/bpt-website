      <b>Beer Pong Turku</b> was founded in 2015 with the purpose of developing the academic Beer Pong culture in Turku. Our goal is to organize all kinds of Beer Pong related activities and introduce new people to the sport. We run whole bunch of different events throughout the year, ranging from bigger tournaments to more laid-back events.

      Even though our roots are in the University of Turku, our events are open to everyone, regardless of whether you are an exchange student or studying in some other university or polytehnic. We also work towards making Beer Pong more inclusive and accessible for everyone. For example, we aim to communicate in English and all of our events include a non-alcoholic option.
      
      Most of our events require a small entry fee to play. Tickets as well as our membership which offers benefits such as tournament discounts can be purchased from our <a href="https://kide.app/community/a5fa65d1-6781-4eff-8f4d-6b27a9580d9d">Kide.app</a> page.

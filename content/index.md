      Do you like Beer Pong? So do we. We also think Beer pong is an important part of the student culture here in Turku. Our purpose is to organize Beer pong related activities and introduce people to the sport. We hold whole bunch of different events throughout the year, ranging from bigger tournaments to more laid-back events. Even though our roots are in the University of Turku, our events are open to everyone, regardless of whether you are an exchange student or studying in some other university or polytehnic.

          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

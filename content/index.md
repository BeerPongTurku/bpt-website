Do you like Beer Pong? So do we. We also think Beer pong is an important part of the student culture here in Turku. Our purpose is to organize Beer pong related activities and introduce people to the sport. We hold whole bunch of different events throughout the year, ranging from bigger tournaments to more laid-back events. Even though our roots are in the University of Turku, our events are open to everyone, regardless of whether you are an exchange student or studying in some other university or polytehnic.
